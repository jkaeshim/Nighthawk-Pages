    "1. Defintion of a library, connect to previous lessons like procedures and how are they useful for coding\n",
    "2. Show the format of a library in use (Python and Psuedocode), and in hack 1 tell them to integrate the library into the code\n",
    "3. Introduce them the many libraries availaible, one at a time, and tell them their uses\n",
    "4. Introduce 1-2 per hack, going to be at least 3-4 hacks\n",
    "5. HW TIME, ask them to replace the code with a library, create a program according to the requirements(>%90 availiable) then another question probably in pseudocode"
